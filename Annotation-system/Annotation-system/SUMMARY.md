| Handle Large Documents | ✅ | Pagination (100 per page) |
| Efficient MongoDB Schema | ✅ | Indexed collections |
| Prevent Duplicates | ✅ | Compound unique index |
| Error Handling | ✅ | Try-catch blocks |
| Good Performance | ✅ | Database indexing |

## 🎯 Architecture Decisions

### Why This Structure?

**Separate Frontend & Backend**
- Independent scaling
- Can deploy separately
- Clear separation of concerns

**Socket.io for Real-Time**
- Bidirectional communication
- Room-based updates (only relevant users)
- Better than polling (checking repeatedly)

**MongoDB**
- Flexible schema (good for documents)
- Easy to add fields
- Native support for ObjectId references

**React Component Structure**
- Each component has single responsibility
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Props for data flow

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexing**
   - Fast queries on `documentId`, `userId`
   - Compound index prevents duplicates efficiently

2. **Pagination**
   - Load 100 annotations at a time
   - Reduces initial load time

3. **Socket.io Rooms**
   - Only users in document room get updates
   - Reduces unnecessary network traffic

4. **Denormalized Data**
   - Store `username` and `userColor` in annotations
   - Faster reads (trade storage for speed)

## 📖 How to Use

### Initial Setup
1. Read `QUICKSTART.md` for quick setup
2. Configure MongoDB connection
3. Install dependencies in both folders
4. Start both servers

### Running the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Using the Application
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Login with username and email
3. Upload a document (.txt or .pdf)
4. Click on document to open
5. Select text and add annotations
6. See real-time updates in other browser tabs!
